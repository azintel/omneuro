## Welcome to Omneuro

This guide is for **new humans and AI agents** joining the Omneuro project.  
It captures everything we‚Äôve learned ‚Äî the wins, the mistakes, the scars ‚Äî so you can **start strong, avoid old pitfalls, and move fast without breaking trust.**

If you read only one document: read this, then follow the cross-references.

## 1. Philosophy

- **Spartan, not messy** ‚Üí Simple rules, consistently applied.  
- **Symmetry** ‚Üí Humans and AI follow the same contracts.  
- **Context is king** ‚Üí Everything you need is documented.  
- **Ops are sacred** ‚Üí Deploys and debugging follow rituals, not improvisation.  
- **Progress over chaos** ‚Üí Avoid ‚Äústartup dev‚Äù thrash. Build like pros.  

---

## 2. Your First Day

### Step 1: Read the Core Docs
- `README-ops.md` ‚Üí Index + orientation.  
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` ‚Üí What the system is.  
- `OPS.md` ‚Üí How we work.  
- `RULES.md` ‚Üí Guardrails.  
- `RUNBOOK.md` ‚Üí What to do when it breaks.  
- `OBSERVABILITY.md` ‚Üí How we see what‚Äôs happening.  
- `CHECKLISTS.md` ‚Üí Ritualized flows (deploy, PR, etc).  
- `CONTRACTS.md` ‚Üí What we promise each other.  

### Step 2: Run Local Services
- Clone repo.  
- Start `brain-api` and `tech-gateway`.  
- Use health endpoints to confirm they‚Äôre alive:  
  - Brain API ‚Üí `http://localhost:8081/healthz`  
  - Tech Gateway ‚Üí `http://localhost:8092/api/tech/health`  

### Step 3: Run the Health Script
- `deploy-ops.sh` has built-in retry loops and green-check verification.  
- Never merge without seeing all green.  

---

## 3. Tools You‚Äôll Use

- **GitHub** ‚Üí Source control + Actions pipeline.  
- **AWS (SSM + CloudWatch)** ‚Üí Secrets + logs.  
- **curl** ‚Üí First line of testing.  
- **Structured JSON logs** ‚Üí Debugging clarity.  
- **ADR files** (`adr/`) ‚Üí Design history and decisions.  

---

## 4. Golden Rules (from RULES.md)

1. No placeholders. Ever.  
2. Health checks must be green before merging.  
3. Debug logs ‚â† production logs (keep them separate).  
4. Schema validation is mandatory pre-merge.  
5. Contracts define truth, not memory.  
6. Always update docs when workflows change.  
7. Rollbacks are automatic ‚Äî don‚Äôt fight them.  
8. Use retries for resilience.  
9. Humans and AI communicate in full sentences, with full context.  
10. No clever hacks that bypass rules.  

---

## 5. Common Pitfalls (Learn From Our Pain)

### AWS / SSM
- Wrong user permissions killed hours.  
- Contract: use IAM roles, not static keys.  

### Logging
- Debug noise drowned real issues.  
- Fix: structured JSON, log levels, separation.  

### Deploys
- GitHub vs manual deploys caused drift.  
- Fix: single pipeline, retries built-in, auto rollback.  

### Health Checks
- We wasted cycles on wrong endpoints.  
- Fix: 1 canonical health endpoint per service.  

### Human/AI Drift
- Copy-paste without checking context = chaos.  
- Fix: confirm intent before executing.  

---

## 6. Day 2‚Äì7: Deep Dive

- **Study ADRs** (`adr/`)  
  See why we made certain choices.  

- **Trace Logs in CloudWatch**  
  Learn our JSON structure.  

- **Follow a Full Deploy Cycle**  
  Run `git push`, watch GitHub Actions, validate with health script.  

- **Break and Fix Something in Sandbox**  
  Use `RUNBOOK.md` to recover.  

---

## 7. Lessons Baked Into Culture

- **Retries are non-negotiable.**  
- **Observability isn‚Äôt optional.**  
- **Schemas prevent drift.**  
- **Docs are part of the product.**  
- **Every frustration became a rule.**  
- **We never ‚Äújust wing it‚Äù anymore.**  

---

## 8. How to Contribute

- **PRs must include:**  
  - Schema validation.  
  - Updated docs (if workflow changed).  
  - Passing health checks.  

- **AI Contributions**  
  - Never truncate due to token limits without warning.  
  - Never overwrite existing info; append and cross-reference.  
  - Always assume your output will be executed as-is.  

---

## 9. Cross-References

- `OPS.md` ‚Üí Rituals for daily dev + deploy.  
- `RUNBOOK.md` ‚Üí Break/fix playbook.  
- `OBSERVABILITY.md` ‚Üí Logging + monitoring.  
- `CHECKLISTS.md` ‚Üí Step-by-step flows.  
- `CONTRACTS.md` ‚Üí System promises.

## 10. Final Note

Onboarding isn‚Äôt just about ‚Äúreading docs.‚Äù  
It‚Äôs about absorbing the discipline we earned by **burning cycles, losing time, and clawing our way to stability.**  

If you follow this guide and the cross-references:  
- You won‚Äôt repeat our mistakes.  
- You‚Äôll be productive on Day 1.  
- And Omneuro will continue to move forward like a professional team.
